### As I was reading theough [HERE](https://thewover.github.io/Dynamic-Invoke/) I came accross a section I wanted to capture and put in my random notes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


##Manual Mapping  
_When a module is manually mapped from disk, a fresh copy of it is used. That way, any hooks that AV/EDR would normally place within it will not be present. If the manually mapped module makes calls into other modules that are hooked, then AV/EDR may still trigger.  
But at least all calls into the manually mapped module itself will not be caught in any hooks. This is why malware often manually maps ntdll.dll.  
They use a fresh copy to bypass any hooks placed within the original copy of ntdll.dll loaded into the process when it was created, and force themselves to only use Nt* API calls located within that fresh copy of ntdll.dll.  
Since the Nt* API calls in ntdll.dll are merely wrappers for syscalls, any call into them will not inadvertantly jump into other modules that may have hooks in place._
