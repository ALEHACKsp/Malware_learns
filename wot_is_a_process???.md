### what is is a process?  
A container consisting of the resources required by a program to execute.  
It contains a virtual address space where it loads resources such as dlls. This address space is unique to the process, and multiple processes can have a resource located at say, address 0x00001000, as the address is private.  
It contains the executable program which contains the initial code to be executed.  
It contains the private handle table, for handles to kernel objects. (basically a syscall table, used to look up win32api calls)  
It contains an access token (security context) which contains all the security info (who is running the process, what perms do they have, what can they do and access)  
It contains threads which are responsible for executing code and opening handles to objects  


### virtual memory  
each process sees an almost empty flat address space (it is virtual because there is no connection between the address we use and the actual address)  
the memory manager handles the mapping of virtual to physical memory - the process itself does not have access to this information.  
Some virtual memory can be swapped out to disk in the case of high usage via a "page" file  
A "page" is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, and it can be shared between processes, to access things such as dlls which are commonly used by user mode process.   Being shared via page allows them to be loaded once and thus saves resources.  
The memory manager is also responsible for getting the page from physical to virtual  
  
32bit processes get 2gb user address space by default (0x00000000-0x80000000), as well as 2gb of address space for system/kernel memory (0x80000000-0xFFFFFFF) - typically one process cannot interfere with another process address space.  
  
  
64bit process get 128TB user process space (0x000000000000-0x7FFFFFFFFFFF - thats a LOT!) and 128TB system/kernel (0xFF8000000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFF) 64bit proccess also have a large area of untouchable "unmapped" space
