what is is a process?
A container consisting of the resources required by a program to execute.
It contains a virtual address space where it loads resources such as dlls. This address space is unique to the process, and multiple processes can have a resource located at say, address 0x00001000, as the address is private.
It contains the executable program which contains the initial code to be executed.
It contains the private handle table, for handles to kernel objects. (basically a syscall table, used to look up win32api calls)
It contains an access token (security context) which contains all the security info (who is running the process, what perms do they have, what can they do and access)
It contains threads which are responsible for executing code and opening handles to objects
