### This repo wil be a dumping ground of stuff I have learnt/am learning

Trying to focus on AV evasion, payloads have been covered in [SLAE](https://kymb0.github.io/slae-3/)  

Going to start with this:  
https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=50  
I will write a blog series on converting this course to dotnet  

I will get more XP on dotnet and C# and then do PEN-300
