### This repo wil be a dumping ground of stuff I have learnt/am learning

Trying to focus on AV evasion, payloads have been covered in [SLAE](https://kymb0.github.io/slae-3/)  

Have completed https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=50  

Currently doing [sektor7 malware development essentials](https://institute.sektor7.net/view/courses/red-team-operator-malware-development-essentials/214144-portable-executable/624069-pe-files-format-and-structure), it has some crossover between PA's Process injection course however this goes much more in-depth to various topics such as PE headers.  

Will have to review my OSCE1 course notes to refresh as I should most likely be able to skip some topics.  

More nuanced techniques are in this series: https://0xpat.github.io/Malware_development_part_1/
