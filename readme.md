### This repo wil be a dumping ground of stuff I have learnt/am learning

Trying to focus on AV evasion, payloads have been covered in [SLAE](https://kymb0.github.io/slae-3/)  

Have completed https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3  
Have completed https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=50  
Have completed https://institute.sektor7.net/view/courses/red-team-operator-malware-development-essentials/  
Have completed https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=37  

Will need to do x64 SLAE at some point: https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=7  
Will have to review my OSCE1 course notes to refresh as I should most likely be able to skip some topics.  

More nuanced techniques are in this series: https://0xpat.github.io/Malware_development_part_1/  

Time to do OSEP, after that likely CRTO, definitely advanced malware by sektor7, then cybernetics/APT prolab
